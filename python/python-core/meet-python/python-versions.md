# Python Versions

---

## Content
Throughout this course, we will be working with the latest version of Python, known as Python 3.

Even though Python 3 is easier to understand and has fewer bugs, you might still see Python 2 code in some places.

There are minimal differences between the two versions. For instance, in Python 3, the text is printed as follows:

```python
print('Python 3')
```

While in Python 2 and older versions:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

Python 2 is no longer updated or improved. Not only are all the current applications in Python 3, but the old ones are also being switched to the newer version.
